**Project Idea**: 'We are planning on creating a website that allows people to do group events (eating, going to a museum, etc.) with one another, whether it is for economic or social reasons.
Example: "Oh no, how can I finish such a large pizza by myself? Oh. I can just use this app to find a stranger to share it with me! Oh boy! What luck!"'

**Group**: Terrance Liang, Ling Dong, Cindy Wu, Tyler (Tianshi) Wang
